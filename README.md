http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/quick-tip-even-quicker-markup-with-sparkup/

### fugitive         

Git integration

*Lots* of stuff

`:Gstatus` and press `-` to stage file

http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/

`:help fugitive`

### rvm              

Add RVM integration

### command-t (`,f`)            

Find files in your project with minimal keypresses

For example `conadus` would find `controllers/admin/users`

`,f path_or_filename`

`,gf path_or_filename` - restrict to files in current directory

`Ctrl + n` - next result

`Ctrl + p` - previous result

`Ctrl + c` - cancel

### snipmate (`TAB`)         

Snippets, press `TAB` to expand

Examples (in a Ruby file):

`def<tab>`

`.each<tab>`

`.eado<tab>`

`ife<tab>`

### gist (`:Gist`)

Gist current file/selection

Requires setting GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_USER Env's

### gundo (`F5`)

Navigate changes history tree 

http://vimcasts.org/episodes/undo-branching-and-gundo-vim/

### tabular

Align stuff

http://vimcasts.org/episodes/aligning-text-with-tabular-vim/

### conque

Terminal/Interactive programs

`:Conque zsh`

`:Conque ls`

Note you can also drop back to the terminal using Ctrl+Z, to get
back to Vim with `%1`. This is not a feature of Conque.

### tcomment (`//`)

Pressing `ctrl + p` will also cycle through paste history

### ack (`,a`)

Search project for text (aka find in files)

`,a word`

`,a "some words"`

### nerdtree (`,p`)             

Project file browser

`,p` opens file browser

`o` / `x` open and close files/folders

`m` menu to move/delete/copy files/folders

`?` Help

I use nerdtree for creating or moving files, but find command-t quicker for
opening files.

### surround (`ys`/`cs`/`ds`)

Allows adding/removing/changing of surroundings

I would highly recommend getting to know this plugin, it is very useful.
Especially when you grok text objects.

*Characters*

`ysiw)`    - surround inner word with `()`

`ysiw(`    - surround inner word with `(  )`

In the above example `iw` can be replaced with any text object or motion.

If you find yourself manually adding surroundings, stop and work out the
correct text object or motion.

`cs"'`     - change surrounding from `"` to `'`

`ds`       - delete surrounding

*Tags*

`yss<p>`  - surround line in `<p>` tags

`cst<div>` - change surround tag to `<div>`

### solarized 

A colour scheme, both light and dark version

`:set background=dark`

`:set background=light`

### fuzzyfinder (`,b`)

Find open buffer by path/filename

### taglist (`,l`)

Lists method names, provide auto complete

Run `ctags -R` in project root to generate tags

### preview (`,P`)

Preview markup files such as Markdown and RDoc

Each format requires the relevant gem to be installed such as `bluecloth`
for Markdown and `github-markup` for RDoc.

### syntastic

Syntax checking

When a file is saved the syntax is automatically checked and any errors
reported.

### vundle

Plugin manager and part of the reason why my vimfiles as so compact

## INSTALLATION

Note: If you are using RVM make sure you use system ruby before installation.
    
    rvm use system

Note: If you already have Vim installed ensure it has support for Ruby:

    vim --version | grep ruby

You should see `+ruby,` if you see `-ruby` you need to reinstall Vim with Ruby support

### Install Vim (if not already installed)

#### MacOS: MacVim / Vim 

    brew install macvim --override-system-vim --enable-clipboard

Add `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin` in your `$PATH` so you use the version of
vim installed by Homebrew, not the one that comes with MacOS.

By installing Vim in this way MacVim and regular Vim are exactly the same.

#### Ubuntu: gVim / Vim

*Server*

    apt-get install vim-nox

*Desktop*

    apt-get install vim-gnome

#### GNU/Linux from source

If you have an old GNU/Linux distro which does not have Vim 7.3 or better in its repos then install from source.

The configure options below leave out any GUI related features as I have only compiled Vim on a server.

Vim source is in a hg (Mercurial) repository so you need to install the hg
client first, e.g.  `sudo apt-get install mercurial`.

    hg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim
    cd vim/vim73
    ./configure
    ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-cscope --enable-pythoninterp --enable-rubyinterp --enable-perlinterp --enable-multibyte
    make
    sudo make install

This installs Vim to `/usr/local/bin,` check this is in your `$PATH` before `/usr/bin` which may contain an older system version of Vim.

If you get an error `no terminal library found` install `libncurses5-dev`.

### Install these vimfiles

Note: You will already have a `~/.vim` folder, either delete or move it.

    mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.old
    git clone https://github.com/krisleech/vimfiles ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    rake install

or run:

    curl https://raw.github.com/krisleech/vimfiles/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh

#### To update to the latest vimfiles

    cd ~/.vim
    rake update

#### Install Dependacies

*MacOS*

    brew install ack
    brew install ctags

Note: MacOS comes with the BSD version of ctags which is not compatible.

*Ubuntu*

    sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
    sudo apt-get install ack-grep
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/local/bin/ack
